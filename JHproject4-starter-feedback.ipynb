The 'admit' column contains a 1 or 0 depending on whether or not a student was admitted to grad school.  The 'gpa' column contains the student's gpa.  The 'gre' column contains the student's gre score.  The 'prestige' column contains the prestige rank of the student's undergraduate institution, with 1 being the most prestigous.  The prestige column was converted to dummy variables with each orestige rank having its own column containing a 1 or 0 depending on that particular student's school's prestige rank."

Each point on your gre score multiplies yours proability of addmission by 1.002221.  Each whole point increase in your gpa multiplies your probability of admission by 2.180027.  Students of prestige rank 2 are about half as likely to be admitted as students of rank 1.  Students of ranks 3 and 4 are about half as likely to be admitted when compared to prestige rank 2."

We will proceed to vary the threshold in order to maximize our models predictive ability.  Additionally, more instances of our data including more variables, for example, race, gender, parental income, etc. would contribute to an improved model."
